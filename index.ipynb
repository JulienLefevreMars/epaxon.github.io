    "\n",
    "Everything about your life, everything you've ever experieced, experience itself, is a result of complex electro-chemical interactions going on in the brain. Neuroscience illustrates how perception is not imposed from the outside, rather it is built from the inside -- our reality is a product of the internal workings of the brain. Although we understand the brain and its function like never before, we are still naive to the basic mechanisms and rules that govern brains and generate consciousness.\n",

    "Neuroscience shows that the brain and mind are intimately related, but there is a fundamental problem with understanding the nature of the mind and consciousness scientifically. This problem stems from the fact that we have no way of directly measuring consciousness. We only know of its [existence][foot:exist] through our own experience of consciousness, and only infer consciousness elsewhere. We have no actual proof of Consciousness! Scientifically, we can only measure correlates of consciousness -- a person reports their experience, or an animal is trained to express behavior to certain conscious experiences. We have no direct access to the actual experience, only to correlates!\n",

    "## The Hard Problem and the Complicated Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The ultimate question that underlies neuroscience is 'What is Consciousness?'. The science behind consciousness is so controversial and the philosophical issues are so prevelant, that in Neuroscience it is a taboo to talk about the \"C-word\". Neuroscientists disagree about the basic concepts of consciousness, and just to begin talking about the C-word, we must first establish the exact notions we wish to discuss. What do we even mean by \"Consciousness\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "In a way, Consciousness is all we've ever known. Each of us experiences the world through our Consciousness, and any truth or bit of knowledge is always filtered through our own minds. But there is a fundamental problem with understanding Consciousness. There is no way for us to directly measure conscious experience, and we have no way of telling whether or not something is conscious. Giulio Tononi continues his manifesto:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"Yet almost everybody thinks that understanding consciousness at the fundamental level is currently beyond the reach of science. The best we can do, it is often argued, is gather more and more facts about the neural correlates of consciousness -- those aspects of brain function that change when some aspects of consciousness change -- and hope that one day we will come up with an explanation. Others are more pessimistic: we may learn all about the neural correlates of consciousness and still not understand why certain physical processes seem to generate experience while others do not.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "> -- [Giulio Tononi, Consciousness as Integragted Information: A provisional manifesto, 2008][Tononi2008]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's first dissect exactly what Tononi means to understand Consciousness at the \"fundamental level\". There are several different notions of Consciousness, but this fundamental level describes the subjective nature of the mind, which philosophers struggle to comprehend.\n",
    "This is more than just the difference between being awake and asleep -- consciousness in the sense of \"Awakeness\". Tononi is not talking about consciousness in the sense of \"Awareness\" -- that we recognize our own conscious being and are self-aware. \n",
    "Tononi is discussing the subjective experience of Consciousness -- the redness of red, the sting of pain, the warmth of heat, the beauty of a vista, consciousness in the sense of \"Qualia\". \n",
    " \n",
    "The nature of Qualia has a long history of mystery and controversy. In the Monadology (1720), G.W. Leibniz offered his famous analogy of the mill to express his belief that consciousness could not arise from mere matter. He imagined someone walking through an expanded brain as one would walk through a mill (one of the more complicated devices of Liebniz's time) and observing all its mechanical operations. For Leibniz, this mechanistic model of the mind exhausted its physical nature. Nowhere, he asserts, would such an observer see any conscious thoughts. Where in the mechanics of the brain would you ever see the symbols used by the mind?\n",
    "\n",
    "We now understand that when we perceive red light, our neurons are firing action-potentials in a particular pattern that corresponds to or \"represents\" this particular wavelength of light. Our subjective experience is the color red, we experience the Qualia of redness, but where does this color reside? Where or how does the redness of red emerge from the wavelength of light and the firing of action potentials? How could we look at a brain and ever scientifically validate that it is *feeling* the color red?\n",
    "\n",
    "Experience is the crux of the issue. As Thomas Nagel points out in his article, \"[What is it like to be a bat?][Nagel1974]\", and in the hypothetical scenario of \"[Mary's Room][Jackson1984]\", even if we knew every detail about brain function, we would still not fully understand what *it is like*. Our third-person scientific perspective could tell us everything about how the bats sonar system works and how the bat performs echo-location, but does this say *anything* about the first-person account? What is it like to have the same conscious experience as the bat? Experience is the fundamental level which Tononi seeks to address, and understanding qualia has come to be known as the \"Hard Problem\":\n",
    "\n",
    "> The really hard problem of consciousness is the problem of experience. When we think and perceive, there is a whir of information-processing, but there is also a subjective aspect. As Nagel (1974) has put it, there is something it is like to be a conscious organism. This subjective aspect is experience. When we see, for example, we experience visual sensations: the felt quality of redness, the experience of dark and light, the quality of depth in a visual field. Other experiences go along with perception in different modalities: the sound of a\n",
    "clarinet, the smell of mothballs. Then there are bodily sensations, from pains to orgasms; mental images that are conjured up internally; the felt quality of emotion, and the experience of a stream of conscious thought. What unites all of these states is that there is something it is like to be in them. All of them are states of experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "> -- David J. Chalmers, Facing Up to the Problem of Consciousness, 1995\n",
    "\n",
    "The subjective experience of the mind is what makes consciousness the \"Hard Problem\". It is hard not because of its complexity, but because the problem seems scientifically intractable. There is simply no conceivable way to measure consciousness directly. Even if we could fully describe the mechanics of the brain as if it were as simple as walking through Liebniz's mill, we would still not necessarily understand experience. We could easily imagine that my experience of red is your experience of blue -- that our brains use different subjective symbols to represent the same ~700nm wavelength light. How could we even know if one person's subjective experience is the same as another's? How could we know if my experience of red is the same as your experience of red? There seems to be no scientific way of answering these types of questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The nature of Consciousness is very intimate to each one of us, yet inaccessible to Science or to someone else. Our identity is directly tied to our Consciousness, and no one but ourselves has or even can have direct access to our experiences.\n",
    "The Hard problem is hard because we have no clear possible way of ever scientifically testing our ideas about Consciousness. Everything that we can possibly say about the mind is correlative. Even when we stimulate someone's brain or alter their perceptions, we cannot measure Consciousness directly. Rather, we can only measure behavioral outputs or a verbal report (in humans) of the state of the mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chalmers distinguishes the hard problem from a set of easier problems facing cognitive science. He characterizes several issues that are related to consciousness, but that do not pose the same philosophical dillemma as experience and qualia. Chalmers suggests that reporting mental states, deliberate control of behavior, and integrating information are all \"easy\" problems -- although answering these questions scientifically may take a few centuries of hard work, there is no reason to expect that the methods of neuroscience would fail to explain them. Chalmers distinguishes these notions, because so many philosophers confuse these two disparate issues. Generally, we reserve the term Consciousness for experience, qualia, subjective mental states, and the Hard Problem, whereas we use the term \"Awareness\" to refer to Chalmers's easy problems of the mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another name for the sum of Chalmers's easy problems is the \"Complicated Problem\". In this sense, we do not mean experience itself, but all of the other fancy things that the brain does -- how do you put together a visual scene? How do you plan and make decisions? How does the brain become aware of its own existence? The Complicated Problem is fundamentally distinct from the Hard Problem, as the Complicated Problem refers to the specifics of the human mind and brain; the Complicated Problem describes the particular set of conscious experiences that manifest over our lifetime, the particulars of the human brain. The Hard Problem is more general, it is about any and all conscious experiences; the Hard Problem describes consciousness in any system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neuroscience has the possibility of understanding the Complicated Problem. We do not find the challenges of linking brain mechanisms to behavior scientifically intractable as we do with Qualia. Awareness is a result of the structure of the human brain, we are aware because our brains were built to make us aware. Our brains are executing the awareness algorithm. Awareness is a type of Qualia, awareness is a particular conscious feeling, and it is implemented by circuits of neurons within your brain. Awareness does not lead to the existential crisis of consciousness -- there is a path for science to someday understand awareness, as only the complexity of the brain is currently holding us back. \n",
    "\n",
    "Key to both the Hard Problem and the Complicated Problem is a phenomenon we generally refer to as \"Emergence\". The ideas of emergence primarily evolved from a single notion: the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Emergence is a result of the complex interaction between the pieces of a system, and often it is not clear, sometimes impossible, to understand the emergent system from the constituent pieces. Emergence is connected to consciousness, somehow consciousness emerges from human biology, and philosophers have thought about emergence since the beginning of Science, too:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"The totality is not, as it were, a mere heap, but the whole is something besides the parts.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "> -- Aristotle, Metaphysics, Book H 1045a 8-10, 350 B.C.E.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the millenia, philosophers have struggled to characterize emergence. Somehow, something different and unexpected occurs at a global or macro \"level\", when many \"pieces\" are interacting in unpredictable ways -- that somehow a consistent whole comes forth that does not directly follow from the pieces themselves. Often, emergent phenomena are described as having \"supervenience\" or \"downward causality\", which is an apparent contradiction with our usual concepts on the nature of causality: systems are made from parts, and those parts causally determine the properties and dynamics of the system. But with emergence, it seems that somehow this normal flow of causalty can be flipped -- the system causally determines the pieces. How could systems reverse causality in such a fashion? Or are we just being tricked?\n",
    "\n",
    "We must carefully define these notions: What exactly is a level and what exactly is a piece? What makes something whole and can we measure its wholeness? What does supervenience/downward causation really mean? Can we explain emergence without breaking the laws of physics? What is the link between consciousness and emergence and how does consciousness emerge from the brain? Where else are there emergent properties?\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, many if not most Neuroscientists and Cognitive Scientists share the belief that the brain is *computing* in some fashion. However, we know the brain performs computation in a fundamentally different manner than our transistor computers, and our theoretical understanding of computation is not complete.\n",
    "Even though we have a formal mathematical theory of computation, philosophers disagree when or if something can be considered to be computing. Some even argue that computation is subjective or observer-based, and everything can be said to be computing depending on how you look at it. The philosophical dillemmas surrounding consciousness and emergence are prevelant because we do not fully understand the nature of computation, and many of these dilemmas will be solved through a more general *Theory of Computation*. What is the mathematical line between systems that can be described as computing and those that are not? Does such a line even exist?  \n",
    "\n",
    "Our understanding of computation was developed only over the last half-century, and has profoundly shaped the way we think about the brain and mind. The fathers of Computer Science and Information Theory have formalized the mathematics of computation around a narrow and very specialized system. We have unlocked the power of computation, and it has completely transformed the world, but we have only uncovered a single modality of computation out of a large space of possibility. Humans have a tendancy to drive towards the most basic and simplistic realization of an idea, and the foundations of computer science are built on a very particular way information could be processed. All silicon computers use the same mechanisms crafted by the fathers of CS, but these mechanisms do not cover all possible forms of computation, only a single and very specific form. It is not clear how to apply these theories of computation to the brain, even though most neuroscientists believe that the brain is computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The issues surrounding Consciousness, Emergence and Computation are all related, because Computation is the force of nature that drives Emergence and Consciousness. \n",
    "To truly understand consciousness, we must first obtain a deeper understanding of computation; we must generalize computation to all physical systems; we must generalize computation to include other means of building a computer; we must describe computation in the same language as we describe physical phenomena. The nature of the physical world, the laws of physics themselves, can be fully described with the mathematics of \"Dynamical Systems Theory.\" By merging *Dynamical Systems Theory* with *Information Theory* we can formulate a general notion of a computer and go beyond the very specific type of computation laid out in computer science. This will allow us to mathematically understand the nature of  Consciousness and Emergence, to link the mind with computation, to recognize consciousness outside of the human brain, and to potentially build conscious systems. The generalization of computer science to dynamical systems is *Computational Dynamics*.\n",
    "By formulating a theory of computation that applies to all physical systems, we will be able to grasp the Hard Problem and put these philosophical issues in a new light.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we seek to build a mathematial definition for Consciousness. However, no matter how well we can formulate a mathematical definition for Consciousness, we still cannot prove its correctness scientifically. Even if we could precisely define and measure everything that is important about the mind, there is still a divide between understanding and scientific proof. Because we cannot directly measure qualia, there is only room for mathematics to *define* qualia, and this definition is up for some subjective interpretations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often in Science, seen from Physics, there is not evidence to make progress towards answering a scientific question. This may be because our conceptualization of a problem is not well founded -- we are not asking the right questions, because we do not have the right framework of understanding. During the Quantum Revolution in physics, many were at a loss to explain the nature of the Universe at the smallest scales. A flood of new experimental data examining the quantum world was pouring in, but the data were too complex for anyone to make sense of it. We are at a similar stage in Neuroscience, except at a larger scale with more data. To make progress in physics, many of the greatest Scientists relied on \"[Beauty](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/2010/06/25/the-evolution-of-the-physicists-picture-of-nature/)\" to dig out the truth, rather than hard evidence. The Universe has some type of intrinsic elegance, and when we uncover something meaningful often this beauty emerges in the form of nice mathematical equations.\n",

If there is not complete agreement between the results of one's work and experiment, one should not allow oneself to be too discouraged, because the discrepancy may well be due to minor features that are not properly taken into account and that will get cleared up with further developments of the theory.\"\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",

    "To make progress in understanding Consciousness, like in physics, we must follow the beauty. Even though our work possibly can never be proven scientifically, a mathematical link between Computation and Consciousness can explain our notions of Consciousness, it can fit our ideas and intuitions of Consciousness, and perhaps fits so well that we'd be hard pressed to deny its truth.\n",
    "\n",
    "The nature of Consciousness requires us to go beyond the brain as well. The Hard Problem screams for a deeper link between Consciousness and physics than just the human brain. An answer to the Hard Problem that links Consciousness beyond the brain is beautiful. We are part of the physical Universe, and finding a fundamental connection between the mind and the laws of nature is beautiful. A deep link between Consciousness and the laws of physics is beautiful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Integrated Information ($\\Phi$) is such a beautiful theory of Consciousness, and is a central metric of Computational Dynamics. The interpretation of the equations of integrated information point to a beautiful link between the mind and the laws of nature. Integrated Information proclaims that Consciousness is the *feeling of information*, a link that goes beyond the brain, and suggests that Consciousness is fundamental to nature and not solely the human mind. But Science is just beginning to glimpse the mathematics surrounding Integrated Information and Computational Dynamics, and there is much to be done to rigorously define and test these concepts. We will have to take steps in further elaborating the mathematics of integrated information and the precise definitions of levels, pieces, systems, integration and information.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are now beginning to understand the deep link between the laws of physics and the properties of information. What Science has revealed is that the Universe is made up of Energy -- that all matter, all light, everything, are merely different forms of the same substance that is the essence of the Universe. Over the last century, we have started to understand the nature of Information, and we are now realizing that Information is too a type of Energy. Some argue that the link is even stronger -- not simply information is a form of Energy, but that Information and Energy are entirely the same. This link is quite profound, and has implications not only for qualia, but also for quantum mechanics and the very fundamental laws of spacetime. This connection between information and energy is the bridge between math and physics. It explains why the Universe is so orderly, yet chaotic, and can be described so well with equations. This link makes a satisfying, beautiful connection between Consciousness and the Universe -- Consciousness is Information, Information is Energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Philosophers have long recognized another link between Consciousness and Quantum Mechanics. At the heart of QM is the unsettling notion of the \"observer\" -- the quantum world is in a state of indeterminant flux, always probabilistically between physical realities, until the state is \"observed\" from the outside. At the immediate moment of observation, the quantum state \"collapses\" into one of many possible realizations. QM is confusing and mysterious, it does not operate with the same intuitive concepts that follow classical mechanics. No one fully understands QM, and many of the questions surrounding the most basic rules of physics are intricately linked with the issues of Consciousness. What is an observer? How does the observer cause a quantum state to collapse from a super-position of many possible outcomes into a physical realization of a single outcome? Does an observer require consciousness? Does the Universe even exist if it is not observed?\n",
    "\n",
    "Among the myriad explanations of Consciousness based on quantum mechanical phenomena, Computational Dynamics is only among them in the sense that information is a fundamental aspect of the basic laws of Nature. Quantum weirdness has been used many times to attempt to explain consciousness, but computational dynamics does not suggest that there is really any direct involvement of quantum mechanical effects in producing Qualia. Rather, Consciousness and Quantum Mechanics are linked through the properties of Information and Energy -- Consciousness and Quantum weirdness are not related because one causes the other, but because both have a common underlying cause, Information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computational Dynamics posits that Consciousness is not unique to the human brain, and this means that there must be other things out there that have consciousness. We have to step outside of our own minds to comprehend the Consciousness of others, and especially of non-human others. This is a daunting task. If we follow the beauty of $\\Phi$, then we begin to see that Consciousness is all around us. That our own Consciousness is of a very particular type, and that other Consciousnesses are out there, but feel very different. Evolution has shaped the algorithms and computations that our brain performs and these are essential to our mind and our subjective experience. We have a particular flavor of consciousness, shaped by the evolution of our brains. It is very hard for us to relate to any other type of Consciousness, because all we have ever known is our own. \n",
    "\n",
    "But we have thus far only managed a glimpse at the beauty of Computational Dynamics and its central metric, Integrated Information. There is much more to be done to formulate the mathematical equations of the mind. But before diving into the math, it is first important to discuss the central result of computational dynamics: that the mind is the brain.\n",
